**A rigorous, 100-day curriculum designed to build a deep foundation in Mathematics and Computer Science.** 

This open-source curriculum bridges the gap between high school algebra and advanced topics like Functional Analysis, Topology, and Theoretical Computer Science. It is designed for self-learners who want to build "operating system" level knowledge—the non-negotiable skills for deep technical work.
